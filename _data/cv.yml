  - title: "Energy oversupply to tissues: a single mechanism possibly underlying multiple cancer risk factors"
    author: "Wu, Daniel J and Aktipis, Athena and Pepper, John W"
    journal: "Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health"
    volume: "2019"
    number: "1"
    pages: "9-16"

    abstract: "Several major risk factors for cancer involve vascular oversupply of energy to affected tissues. These include obesity, diabetes and chronic inflammation. Here, we propose a potential mechanistic explanation for the association between energy oversupply and cancer risk, which we call the metabolic cancer suppression hypothesis: We hypothesize that oncogenesis is normally suppressed by organismal physiology that regulates and strictly limits normal energy supply to somatic cells, and that this protection is removed by abnormal oversupply of energy.We evaluate this hypothesis using a computational model of somatic cell evolution to simulate experimental manipulation of the vascular energy supply to a tissue. The model simulates the evolutionary dynamics of somatic cells during oncogenesis.In our simulation experiment, we found that under plausible biological assumptions, elevated energy supply to a tissue led to the evolution of elevated energy uptake by somatic cells, leading to the rapid evolution of both defining traits of cancer cells: hyperproliferation, and tissue invasion.Our results support the hypothesis of metabolic cancer suppression, suggesting that vascular oversupply of energetic resources to somatic cells removes normal energetic limitations on cell proliferation, and that this accelerates cellular evolution toward cancer. Various predictions of this hypothesis are amenable to empirical testing, and have promising implications for translational research toward clinical cancer prevention."

    journal: "Proceedings of Workshop on Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries at ICLR"
    year: "2020"
    abstract: "Human re-identification through gait analysis is a promising application of discriminative neural networks -- particularly due to the ubiquitousness of the primary sources of gait acceleometry, in-pocket cellphones. We show that binarized neural networks can act as robust discriminators; maintaining both an acceptable level of accuracy while also dramatically decreasing memory requirements, thereby enabling on-device inference."

    author: "Wu, Daniel J and Yang, Andrew C and Prabhu, Vinay U"
    journal: "Proceedings of Workshop on Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries at ICLR"
    year: "2020"
    abstract: "We present Afro-MNIST, a set of synthetic MNIST-style datasets for four orthographies used in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages: Ge`ez (Ethiopic), Vai, Osmanya, and N'Ko. These datasets serve as ``drop-in'' replacements for MNIST. We also describe and open-source a method for synthetic MNIST-style dataset generation from single examples of each digit. These datasets can be found at https://github.com/Daniel-Wu/AfroMNIST. We hope that MNIST-style datasets will be developed for other numeral systems, and that these datasets vitalize machine learning education in underrepresented nations in the research community."

  - title: "A preliminary study of sperm identification in microdissection testicular sperm extraction samples with deep convolutional neural networks"
    author: "Wu, Daniel J and Badamjav, Odgerel and Reddy, Vikrant V and Eisenberg, Michael, and Behr, Barry"
    journal: "Asian Journal of Andrology"

    abstract: "Sperm identification and selection is an essential task when processing human testicular samples for in vitro fertilization. Locating and identifying sperm cell(s) in human testicular biopsy samples is labor intensive and time consuming. We developed a new computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system, which utilizes deep learning for near human-level performance on testicular sperm extraction (TESE), trained on a custom dataset. The system automates the identification of sperm in testicular biopsy samples. A dataset of 702 de-identified images from testicular biopsy samples of 30 patients was collected. Each image was normalized and passed through glare filters and diffraction correction. The data were split 80%, 10%, and 10% into training, validation, and test sets, respectively. Then, a deep object detection network, composed of a feature extraction network and object detection network, was trained on this dataset. The model was benchmarked against embryologists' performance on the detection task. Our deep learning CASA system achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.741, with an average recall (AR) of 0.376 on our dataset. Our proposed method can work in real time; its speed is effectively limited only by the imaging speed of the microscope. Our results indicate that deep learning-based technologies can improve the efficiency of finding sperm in testicular biopsy samples."

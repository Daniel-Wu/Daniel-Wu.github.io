I guess this is the page where I'm supposed to talk about how great I am. No wonder it's so short.

I grew up in Orlando, and now I'm a student at Stanford. For some period of my life, I
was interested in debate (Lincoln-Douglas, Policy, British Parliamentary), public policy, continental philosophy, writing,
game theory, number theory, entreprenuership, surrealism, travel, genetics, plant biology, photography, effecive altruism, viola, clarinet, flute, piano. 
Now, like other folks in the valley, I do ML.

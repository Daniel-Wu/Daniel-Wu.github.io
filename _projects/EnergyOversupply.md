Cancer risk factors, such as obesity, inflammation,
and diabetes, have been associated with
carcinogenesis by a wide variety of molecular
mechanisms; however, ecological, evolutionary and
microenvironment-centered mechanisms are under-
explored. A common theme underlying these risk
factors is the creation of resource oversupply.
We propose normal physiology restricts resource
availability to a bare maintenance level, limiting
proliferation. Furthermore, we conjecture that lifting
this restriction allows for abnormal proliferation and
creates a selective pressure for cancer-associated
phenotypes, accelerating carcinogenesis. This
evolutionary mechanism suggests generalizable
treatment and prevention strategies.

We built an agent-based model of tissue, and simulated the development of cancer under various
resource access conditions. We found that resource oversupply significantly expedites clonal
expansion and metastasis.

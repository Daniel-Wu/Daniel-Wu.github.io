During Freshman year, a friend told me about a public secret — that you could see what your
Stanford Admissions officer wrote [on your application.](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/24/freshmen-can-view-admissions-comments-inaccessible-to-upperclassmen/) All we had to do was fill out a crusty [web form](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/forms/records-request-ferpa.fb), wait up to 45 calendar days, and then walk into the Office of the Registrar to view them.

These comments were pretty interesting; especially because the admissions officer thought in an entirely different way than I had expected. I obviously couldn't leave it at that — after forwarding this information to as many people as I could, Andrew Yang and I compiled a set of essays and comments from members of the Classes of 2022 and 2023, and wrote a book: *Inside Stanford Admissions*. In the book, we give our own perspectives on how to get in and what to write. We analyze student profiles, and present the raw comments written by admissions officers for each student. Check it out at Amazon or Barnes and Noble.

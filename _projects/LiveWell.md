More people have access to smartphones than clean water. Poor water quality can cause a multitude of 
diseases, including but not limited to Diarrhea, Dysentery, Salmonella, and Cholera.

We decided to address a major root cause: poor water well maintenance. By pulling well data from The Humanitarian Data Exchange
we were able to create a map of existing water wells in Djibouti. 
We then built an application in React Native that allowed users to report new water wells, 
make updates to the quality of current ones, and report any water well issues all in real-time.

This project began as a hack done at TreeHacks 2019, and won the prize for best usage of public safety data.
Afterwards, this project graduated from Coding It Forward's Build accelerator.

My Heart Counts is a large-scale cardiovascular health study conducted through an iOS app, released by the Ashley Lab.
Users of the app enter demographic information, take cardiovascular health surveys, 
and are prompted to take a 6 minute walk test, wherein data from the device's onboard accelerometer 
and gyroscope are collected. 

I'm working on training deep convolutional neural networks for the inference of demographic information and cardiovascular risk from gait. 

Here's a poster we presented on our work.

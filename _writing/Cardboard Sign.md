	and certainly not representative of the general experience."

The sign is a wall. 

I'm on one side, the world is on the other.  
I'm outside.  
Outside doors, outside walls.  
Outside minds, outside hearts.  
Beat black and blue by blue and black.  
The doors I close are inside.  
Abjection breeds abstraction. 

The sign is a magic wand. 

Magically, the call they've got is pressing.  
Magically, the air ahead is hypnotizing.  

The sign is a sign.  

A sign of inequality.  
A sign of poverty.  
A sign of complacency.  
A sign of apathy.

It's just a cardboard sign.
